    "1. how developed python programming language.?\n",
    "Ans: Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Which type of Programming dose python support.?\n",
    "Ans: Python is a general-purpose programming language that can be used for a wide range of projects. It supports object-oriented programming, structured programming, functional programming, aspect-oriented programming, and procedural programming paradigms. Python also has several libraries and packages available, allowing developers to easily use existing code to create new applications. Python has been used for web development, artificial intelligence, data analysis, image processing, scientific computing, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "Ans: Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language. This means that identifiers like myVariable and myvariable would be seen as two different identifiers in Python. In addition, Python is a whitespace-sensitive language, meaning that the indentation of your code will determine how the code is parsed and executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. what is the correct extension of the python file?\n",
    "Ans: The standard extension for Python files is \".py\". When you save a Python script, you should save it with a filename that ends in \".py\" to indicate that it is a Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your script is called \"my_script.py\", you can run it using the Python interpreter by executing the command python my_script.py in the terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. is python code compiled or interpreted?\n",
    "Ans: Python code is typically interpreted, which means that the Python interpreter reads and executes the code directly, without first translating it into a lower-level format that can be executed by the computer's CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in python language?\n",
    "Ans: In Python, there are several types of code blocks that you can define to organize your code and control its execution. Some of the most common blocks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions: A block of code that performs a specific task and can be called from other parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes: A block of code that defines a new type of object with its own properties and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops: A block of code that repeats a set of instructions multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements: A block of code that executes different instructions based on whether a certain condition is true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules: A block of code that can be imported into other parts of the program to provide additional functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try/except blocks: A block of code that allows you to catch and handle exceptions that might occur during program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "With blocks: A block of code that provides a context for working with certain resources, such as files or network connections, and ensures that they are properly opened and closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples of the types of code blocks you can define in Python. Each of these blocks helps you to organize your code and make it more readable and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. state a character used to give single-line comments in python?\n",
    "Ans: In Python, you can create single-line comments by using the hash symbol (#). Any text that appears after the # symbol on a line is treated as a comment and is ignored by the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following code includes a single-line comment:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "In this example, the comment is used to provide a brief explanation of what the code does. The Python interpreter will ignore the comment and only execute the print statement. Comments can be very useful for documenting your code and making it more understandable for other developers who might need to read or modify it in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. mention function which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?\n",
    "Ans: To find the version of Python we are using, you can use the sys.version attribute. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Python version\")\n",
    "print(sys.version)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called\n",
    "Ans: Yes, Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime using a construct called \"lambda functions\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are a way to define small, one-time use functions without assigning them a name. They are often used in situations where a function is needed for a short period of time and does not need to be reused elsewhere in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are defined using the lambda keyword, followed by the function's arguments and a colon, and then the function body\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. what does pip stand for python?\n",
    "Ans: In Python, \"pip\" stands for \"Pip Installs Packages\". Pip is a package manager for Python that allows you to install, upgrade, and manage software packages written in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pip is used to install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) and other package repositories. It can also be used to manage dependencies for your Python projects, making it easier to share your code with others and ensure that they have all the nec essary packages installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pip comes installed by default with most distributions of Python, starting with Python 3.4, so you can use it right away to install packages for your Python projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. mention a few built-in functions in python?\n",
    "Ans: Python has many built-in functions that are available for use without the need to import any modules. Here are a few examples of commonly used built-in functions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(): Prints the specified values to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "len(): Returns the length of an object such as a string, list, or tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "input(): Accepts user input from the keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "str(), int(), float(): Convert a value to a string, integer, or float data type, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "range(): Generates a sequence of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "min(), max(): Returns the minimum or maximum value from a sequence.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "14. how is memory managed in python?\n",
    "Ans: In Python, memory management is handled automatically by the Python interpreter. Python uses a technique called \"reference counting\" to keep track of objects in memory and determine when they can be deleted. When an object is created in Python, the interpreter assigns it a unique ID and a reference count of one. The reference count is incremented each time the object is referenced or stored in another variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an object's reference count drops to zero, Python automatically deletes the object and frees up its memory. This process is known as \"garbage collection\". Python also uses a separate mechanism called \"cyclic garbage collection\" to detect and remove circular references, where two or more objects reference each other in a cycle and have a reference count of one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "15. how to install python on windows and set path variables?\n",
    "Ans: To install Python on Windows and set up path variables, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the latest version of Python from the official website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Python on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the installation process, make sure to select the option to add Python to the system PATH variable. This will ensure that you can use Python from the command prompt without having to specify the full path to the Python executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the installation is complete, open a command prompt and type \"python\" to verify that Python is installed and working correctly. You should see the Python interactive shell appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up path variables manually, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Open the Start menu and search for \"Environment Variables\".\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Click on \"Edit the system environment variables\".\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Click on the \"Environment Variables\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. Under \"System Variables\", scroll down to the \"Path\" variable and click \"Edit\".\n",
    "\n",
    "e. Click \"New\" and add the path to the Python installation directory\n",
    "\n",
    "f. Click \"OK\" to close all the windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a new command prompt and type \"python\" to verify that the path variables have been set up correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! Python should now be installed on your Windows system and you should be able to use it from the command prompt or any other applications that rely on Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "16. is indentation required in python?\n",
    "Ans: Yes, indentation is required in Python. Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly braces or other delimiters, to indicate the scope of code blocks. This means that the number of spaces or tabs used to indent a line of code determines its relationship to the surrounding code.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there were no indentation, the code would be invalid and would raise a syntax error.\n",
    "In summary, indentation is a fundamental part of Python syntax, and is required for the code to be valid and executable.\n"
